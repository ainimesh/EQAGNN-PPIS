# E(Q)AGNN-PPIS

This is the code repository for the paper E(Q)AGNN-PPIS:Attention Enhanced Equivariant Graph Neural Network for Protein-Protein Interaction Site Prediction

## Introduction

We introduce E(Q)AGNN-PPIS, an equivariant geometric graph neural network architecture that leverages geometric information, designed to focus on PPI site prediction. The proposed E(Q)AGNN-PPIS is the first method to leverage the expressive power of equivariant message passing, incorporating both scalar and vector features, while introducing an attention mechanism to selectively focus on the most relevant features and interactions during message passing in the PPI site prediction task.
